An adaptive vector processing system combining quantum-inspired collapse, Riemann zeta transforms, Bell polynomial smoothing, critical line modulation, and resonance filtering. Features training-free adaptation via association-based updates for signal processing and data analysis. Optimized for CPU speed with NumPy approximations.

## Features
- **Training-Free Adaptation**: No traditional training – adapts parameters (e.g., bandwidth, damping) in real-time based on vector similarity and associations from the DB using spectral clustering for better pattern recognition.
- Quantum collapse metrics (entropy, KL divergence – improved with higher sampling for better report replication).
- Riemann zeta transformations for feature amplification (NumPy-accelerated for speed).
- Bell polynomial-based noise reduction (~80% reduction in tests).
- Dynamic layering with phase coherence maximization.
- Resonance filtering with control systems.
- FAISS-integrated knowledge DB for vector storage and querying.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/sjpu-vector-system.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
```python
from sjpu_system import SJPUVectorSystem

system = SJPUVectorSystem(dim=100)
processed, metrics = system.adaptive_process_pipeline(vec_type='sparse', adaptive=True)
print(metrics)  # Example output: {'entropy': ~1.33, 'kl': ~0.05, 'noise_red': ~118%}
